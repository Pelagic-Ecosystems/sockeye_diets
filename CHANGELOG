# Changelog


## [0.0.1] - 2019-01-23
### Added
- Added my raw scripts, raw data, figs, processed files from my personal spatial, temporal and zooplankton files to new 'sockeye_diets' project folder
- Raw data were produced by downloading the fish_lab_data file from the HAkai JSP Data Release Package 1.0, selecting the ufn's required for my study, and creating new fields for entering diet information
- The data and scripts are for 2 separate chapters: 
        1. Spatial: samples were processed and diet information filled in between 2017-06 and 2018-04
        2. Temporal: samples were processed and diet information filled between 2018-04 and 2018-11
