## Sockeye Diet Data

sam.id:
* My numbers for tracking my progress through the samples, starting at 1

sam.proc.date:
* Date when stomach contents were processed by me in the lab

lab.proc.date:
* Date when stomachs were removed from the fish in the lab at Hakai

ufn:
* universal fish number

region:
* in DI:
** West = D06, D10
** Central = D07, D09
** East = D08, D10
* in JS:
** North = J06, J04, J02
** South = J07, J08, J09

dry.content.w:
* weight of stomach contents after removing them from ethanol and blotting them (sample appears dessicated, hence why called 'dry weight')

wet.content.w:
* weight of stomach contents after removing from ethanol and soaking in water for 30 minutes and then blotting (samples reabsorb water)

corrected.ww:
* the wet.content.w * 1.56, which is a correction factor I developed in the lab to account for sample weight loss due to the preservation method. Storing in ethanol causes weight loss, rehydrating in water causes further weight loss, therefore samples are multiplied by ethanol correction factor to return them to 'fresh weight' equivalents so they can be used to compare to fish body weight

fullness.cat:
* this was a visual assessment of stomach fullness upon opening, categorized into one of five groups: 0, 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100

fullness.mean:
* the average of the range from fullness.cat. E.g. the mean of '1-25' would be 12.5

fullness.est:
* my visual estimate of stomach fullness to a percentage

phylum, class, order, infraorder, family, genus, species:
* taxonomic information collected for each diet item. Items were identified to lowest taxonomic level possible, however this was easier done for some than others, and depending on digestive state.
* ID to phylum: Chaetognatha, Bryozoa
* ID to class: ostracoda, barnacles, bivalvia, actinopterygii
* ID to order: some calanoids, some decapods, some euphausiids, harpacticoids, insects (e.g. diptera), cumacea, some amphipods, siphonophorae
* infraorder was used mostly to separate larval crabs when they cuoldn't be id'd to family
* ID to family: most decapods were only to family, podonidae, some hyperiidae, gammaridae, spionidae, caprellidae, some euphausiids
* ID to genus: most copepods, most euphausiids, all oikopleura, some cladocerans, some hyperiid amphipods (e.g. themisto, hyperoche), tomopteris (only polychaete to genus)
* ID to species: some copepods
* Note: there were two stomachs with parasitic worms (Anisakis spp.) inside the stomachs. These were ID'd, but not inlcuded in diet analyses

plot.taxon: 
* initial ID categories after lab ID - 16 categories with latin names

plot.taxon.g:
* final 'grouped' taxonomic categories (9) used for plotting

plot.taxon.d:
* detailed taxonomic categories (66) used for detailed diet analyses such as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices, NMDS, ANOSIM, and for looking at small scale differences in diet composition plots between sites
* Note, there is some redundancy in this category (e.g. Calanoid, digested calanoid, Aetideus divergens --> all fall into same broad category of 'calanoid' however are separated into 3 different taxanomic categories here)

labID: 
* the initial ID give to the item during lab processing

life.stage:
* not recorded regularly, only really used when lifestage was obvious or made ID difficult
* e.g. euphausiids: eggs, calytopsis, furcilia, juvenile, adult
* decapods: separated into megalopa or zoea
* used to identify copepod nauplii or <CVI stages (sometimes)

sex:
* this data was rarely recorded.. only recorded for species in which it was obvious (some copepods like Epilabidocera spp.)

DI:
* digestive index on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the most fresh, 4 being completely digested but still identifiable to some category, 5 being completely digested with no idea what it is

size:
* all prey items were grouped into one of five size categories: <1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10, >10

length.min, length.max, and length.avg:
* for each digestive index of each taxa, the collection of food items was visually assessed and a max and min length recorded for the smallest and largest individuals in the collection. The length.avg is just a calculated average between the max and min value

group.weight:
* this is the weight of each collection of items in each digestive state of each taxonomic category in each stomach. Each 'pile' of food items was blotted to remove excess moisture before being weighed to the nearest 0.0001mg

corrected.weight:
* group.weight multiplied by the ethanol conversion facto as mentioned above (x 1.56)

comments:
* comments mostly made by Hakai lab staff during fish dissections, some comments from me during diet analysis

dylan.proc:
* filled in as Y (yes) or N (no)
* some of the stomachs had some analyses conducted on them prior to mine (conducted by Dylan Smith for Sean Godwin). For this, they were removed from ethanol, stomach fullness was visually assessed, stomach contents were removed and left to dry (ethanol allowed to evaporate) prior to being weighed and returned to vials of ethanol. I made note of this because I found in general that the food items from these stomachs were in worse condition than those that hadn't previously been touched. The extra processing/having the contents preserved directly in ethanol may have degraded the samples somewhat.

overnight:
* filled in as Y (yes) or N (no)
* sometimes, for very full stomachs, I had to leave them in my sample tray with a bit of water, covered in parafilm overnight. I made note of this because leaving them overnight may affect the DNA (if the samples were to be used for future DNA analyses)


## Zooplankton Taxonomic Data (zoopcomp)

Note the samples were collected from Hakai and the tow data was obtained from Mat Foster prior to data being available on the data portal. Taxonomic data was entered by lab technicians at UBC (myself(Sam James), Andrea Lee, and Jihyun Kim)

sampleID:
* the unique QPK or JSPK number assigned to each sample in the field

region:
* in DI:
** West = D06, D10
** Central = D07, D09
** East = D08, D10
* in JS:
** North = J06, J04, J02
** South = J07, J08, J09

depth:
* depth of zooplankton tow in meters. All tows for the JSP were conducted at the surface

* calculated volume of water sampled by the zooplankton net using the equation provided by General OCeanics:
* ((pi * (net diameter^2))/4) * distance

vol.cor:
* corrected volume measurements after Brett Johnson's QA/QC of the data

sieve:
* samples were size fractioned in the lab using a 3 size sieve stack: 250um, 1000um, and 2000um

fraction.proc:
* fraction of total sample processed. Sometimes there was too much material in each sieve to process and then the sample would be split using either a folsom splitter or a stempel
* the target was to count at least ~300 specimens in a subsample but not to split to below 1% of the total sample
* therefore, values range from 0.01 - 1

sizeclass:
* specimens were grouped into the same size classes as the salmon diet items for comparison: <1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10, >10

phylum, class, order, infraorder, family, genus, species:
* taxonomic information collected for each diet item. Items were identified to lowest taxonomic level possible, however this was easier done for some than others (may have also varied depending on abilities of the lab technician)
* ID to phylum: Chaetognatha, bryozoa, phoronida, echinodermata, some ctenophora
* ID to class: barnacles (as Maxillopoda), bivalvia, gastropoda, most polychaetes
* ID to order: some calanoids, some amphipods, some harpacticoids, some euphausiids, most jellies (e.g. siphonophorae, anthomedusae, letpomedusae), insects (e.g. Diptera), isopods, some decapods, * ID to family: some euphausiids, most decapods (e.g. Hippolytidae, Cancridae, CAllianassidae), pleurobrachiidae, some polychaetes (e.g. spionidae, flabelligeridae, tomopteridae), some amphipods (e.g. just to hyperiidae or gammaridae), fish larvae
* ID to genus: some jellies (e.g. Clytia, sarsia), cladocerans, most copepods, most amphipods (e.g. themisto), some harpacticoids (e.g. Microsetella), oikopleura, some siphonophores (e.g. Nanomia)
* ID to species: mostly copepods, some jellies (e.g. Aequorea victoria, Annatiara affinis, Amphinema platyhedos)

plot.taxon: 
* initial ID categories after lab ID - 16 categories with latin names

plot.taxon.g:
* final 'grouped' taxonomic categories (9) used for plotting

plot.taxon.d:
* detailed taxonomic categories (66) used for detailed diet analyses such as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices, NMDS, ANOSIM, and for looking at small scale differences 
* Note, there is some redundancy in this category (e.g. Calanoid, Aetideus divergens --> both fall into same broad category of 'calanoid' however are separated into 2 different taxanomic categories here)

labID: 
* the initial ID give to the item during lab processing

stage:
* not recorded regularly, only really used when lifestage was obvious or made ID difficult
* e.g. euphausiids: eggs, calytopsis, furcilia, juvenile, adult
* decapods: separated into megalopa or zoea
* used to identify copepod nauplii or <CVI stages (sometimes)
* bivalve veligers
* eggs
* some polychaete trocophores

sex:
* this data was rarely recorded.. only recorded for species in which it was obvious (some copepods like Epilabidocera spp.)

length:
* length was only recorded for specimens >2mm. When there were many specimens, an average was estimated

count:
* the total count within the subsample

totcount:
* the total count when 'count' is divided by the fraction processed

abundance:
* the 'totcount' divided by 'vol.cor', to get # individuals per m3

lab.processor:
* who analysed the sample in the lab


## Zooplankton Biomass Data (zoopww)

Note: most columns are the same as in the zoopcomp file and aren't listed here

ww: 
* wet weight of the sample in each sieve in mg
* after sample was split, the sieve was blotted using kimtech wipes from the back to remove excess moisture before the sample was removed from the sieve and weighed

biomass:
* 'ww' divided by 'vol.cor' to get mg/m3

processor.notes:
* mostly used to indicate whether the weight was for gelatinous or non-gelatinous items. If there were gelatinous items in the sieve, they were removed and weighed separately
